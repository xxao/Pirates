# The Pirates

Working on...


## Print the cards

In order to print the cards you need to download and print all the PDFs located in the [Prints](https://github.com/xxao/Pirates/tree/master/Prints) folder. Be sure to use good quality **double-sided photo paper**. I was very happy with results on a 230 g/m2 paper with matte finish.

The game consists of two types of cards, each should be printed with different background.

- The special cards like tokens, ships and the center board card are all having the brown, wood-like background. Corresponding files are marked with _A_ suffix and should be printed with the _background_A.pdf_ file.

- The regular cards making actual board are all having the blue, see-like background. Corresponding files are marked with _B_ suffix and should be printed with the _background_B.pdf_ file.

Note that the background itself is drawn a few millimeters bigger than the faces to eliminate white edges caused by inaccurate printing alignment. Keep that in mind and always use the faces to cut out individual cards. A paper cutter is highly recommended.


## What else you need

Once the cards are printed and cut, there are still some additional items you need in order to start playing.

- Each player needs three figures. Those should be easily distinguishable from other players. You can use the color figures from _Man Don't Get Angry_ or your favorite LEGO minifigures.

- A pack of some nice coins to represent the treasure. Again, you can use some LEGO pieces or there are several options available on Amazon.

- Two dice of your choice.


## Prepare the game

To prepare the main board, lay down the grid of 11x11 with cards having the blue see-like background (face down). Just in the middle, there should be the dice card with no coins (face up). (This card should be easy to find, since it has the brown wood-like background.) 

Depending on number of players, put one ship with figures to the middle of each side of the grid.

## The cards

### Tools and Tokens
 These are special cards used mainly as tokens, indicating that the player found corresponding item and can use it. For example, when a player finds one of the _Secret Island_, he/she takes a copy of the card to indicate the island ownership. All these cards have the brown wood-like background.

#### Dice Table
Used as center card of the main board. This is where the bet coins are placed each time someone finds the _Dice_ card. Pirate figures are not allowed to step on this card. Only when there is no other possibility, the player should move one card ahead, continuing original direction.

#### Ship
Each user has its own ship, which is allowed to move around the board. It is used to move figures around, pick lonely pirates and carry the treasure coins.

Whenever a player discovers one of the three available islands, he/she takes this token to indicate the island ownership. Please note the island scar and take corresponding token card. The player keeps the card for the rest of the game.

#### Secret Map (token)
Whenever a player discovers one of the three available secret maps, he/she takes this token to indicate the island position knowledge. Please note the top left scar and take corresponding token card. The player keeps the card for the rest of the game.

#### Old Gin (token)
Whenever a player discovers one of the available magic Gins, he/she takes this token to indicate number of remaining wishes. Once the magic power is used to move a pirate figure, the token card must be returned.
